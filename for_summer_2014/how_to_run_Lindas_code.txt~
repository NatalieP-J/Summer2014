The way this works is the following:

1.  Open GalaxyFcnsRho_writtenout.nb
Evaluation -> Evaluate Notebook.
That runs quickly, and just defines each of the functions without making them.  There are two parts:  defining the functions, and then defining how to make the tables to approximate them in the right range.


2.  Open GalaxyfcnsRho_runme.nb
Evaluate step by step.
Some of these run slowly.  Here is where you actually create a model for a given galaxy, given alpha, beta, etc., calculating tables for psi, g, mathcalG, etc.
