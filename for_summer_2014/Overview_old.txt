The goal for this dynamics work for now is: calculate rate as fcn of peri for given input rho (of the alpha, beta, gamma form).  Goals along the way: (big to small):

1. calculate peri-integrated rate, and compare with DM
2. calculate all the fcns necessary to do that
3. have makemathcalG run in a reasonable amount of time, and accurately

To do #3, I'm trying different ways of calculating the integrals.  Remember that the issue is the endpoints of the integrals.  I'm trying methods with tiny epsilon and iterating to convergence, and MonteCarlo methods.  I'm comparing the times each takes to run, and their accuracy.

I'm having some annoyance with debugging the GalaxyFcnsRho.m file-- how do I access the functions inside?  So I copied all their contents to another notebook to run.

To start working on this again, do the following:

1.  Open GalaxyFcnsRho_writtenout.nb
Evaluation -> Evaluate Notebook.

2. Open testing_GalaxyfcnsRho.nb
Run the steps there in order and look at output from makemathcalg in particular.
Plot things to make sure I'm getting the right behavior, look at time things took, how good the convergence is, etc.  What's a good convergence tolerance, anyway?

3.  I think I was having a problem with Jc2 as well-- it wasn't converging on the right value if the guess was bad.... look at that too.  But I think I fixed it?

4.  When ready to start testing rates, look at ratetestrho_openme.nb.


The folder called "testing" contains eps files of my plots for NGC 4467.
